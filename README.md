   <div class="content">
            <p>Ten unforgettable tales of fascinating human encounters with animals and birds- a man-eater that terrorizes an entire village; the strange and wonderful trust that develops between a fierce leopard and a boy; revengeful monkeys who never forgive a woman who grows dahlias; a crow who genuinely thinks human beings are stupid; and many others- that create a world in which men and wild creatures struggle to survive despite each other: a world where, in the end, one is not quite sure which side one is on.
